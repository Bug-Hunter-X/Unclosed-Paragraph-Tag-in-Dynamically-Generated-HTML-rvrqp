# Unclosed Paragraph Tag in Dynamically Generated HTML

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to unclosed paragraph tags within dynamically generated content.  The bug arises when inserting HTML fragments into the DOM without ensuring all tags are properly closed. This can cause unexpected layout behavior and rendering problems, especially in complex web applications.

The `bug.html` file showcases the issue, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected code.

**Bug:** The script in `bug.html` inserts HTML into a div, but the second paragraph tag is missing its closing tag (`</p>`). This can lead to rendering errors and unexpected layout behavior.

**Solution:** The `bugSolution.html` file corrects this by ensuring all HTML tags are properly closed within the dynamically generated content.
